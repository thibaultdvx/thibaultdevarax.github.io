This is a demo of what you can do with in a markdown. 

[View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

# Basics

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers:

## A subtitle (level 2)

### Header level 3

Alternative header level 2 (use '=' instead of '-' for level 1)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags
  
An image, located within `docs/images`:

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/images/example.png "an image title")

## Lists

* A bulletted list
  - an indented list item
* Second element  
    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
* A third element.

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

## Markup styles

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`
- ~~Strikethrough~~
- ==very important words==
- H~2~O
- X^2^


### Code

```python
for k in range(10):
    print('hello world!')
```

### Quotes

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

> #### Quotes and other elements
>
> - item A.
> - item B.
>
>  *Everything* works as **expected**.

## Tables

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| A            | True           | 23.99         |
| B            | True           | 23.99794882   |

* :- means the column is left aligned.
* -: means the column is right aligned.
* :-: means the column is center aligned.

Vertical bars don't need to be aligned in markdown.
Besides, you call also format text in your tables:
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :- | :-: | -: |
| A | True | *23.99* |
| B | True | **23.99794882** |

## Horizontal lines

## Links

A link to [an external website](https://iabm2025.sciencesconf.org/).
A reference to a [section](#header-1).
You can also emphasis *[a reference](#a-subtitle-level-2)* (here with italic).
And a reference [to another page of the website]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /docs/_posts/2025-03-11-welcome.md %}).

You can also use reference-style links: here is [an example][a label].

[a label]: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links

## Escaping special characters

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

## Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

# Advanced

Some of these words <ins>will be underlined</ins>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first sentence of my indented paragraph.

<center>This text is centered.</center>

<font color="red">This text is red!</font>

:warning: **Warning:** Do not push the big red button.

:memo: **Note:** Sunrises are beautiful.

:bulb: **Tip:** Remember to appreciate the little things in life.
