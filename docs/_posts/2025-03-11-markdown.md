This is a demo of what you can do with in a markdown. 

[View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

## Basics

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. 

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags

Jump

\

two lines.

Next up are some headers:

### A subtitle {#a-label-for-this-header}

#### Header level 3

### Lists

* A bulletted list
  - an indented list item
* Second element  
    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.
* A third element.

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

### Markup styles

- *italics* or _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`
- ~~strikethrough~~

### Code

```python
for k in range(10):
    print('hello world!')
```

### Quotes

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

> Quotes and other elements
>
> - item A.
> - item B.
>
>  Everything works as **expected**.

### Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote[^1], and here's a longer one[^bignote].

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

### Tables

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| A            | True           | 23.99         |
| B            | True           | 23.99794882   |

* :- means the column is left aligned.
* -: means the column is right aligned.
* :-: means the column is center aligned.

Vertical bars don't need to be aligned in markdown.
Besides, you can also format text in your tables:

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :- | :-: | -: |
| A | True | *23.99* |
| B | True | **23.99794882** |

### Horizontal lines
 
*****

### Links

A link to [an external website](https://iabm2025.sciencesconf.org/).  
An email: <fake@example.com>.  
A reference to a [section](#basics).  
You can also emphasis *[a reference](#header-level-3)* (here with italics).  
You can change the label used to refer to [a section](#a-label-for-this-header).  
And a reference [to another page of the website]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-03-11-welcome.md %}).  

You can also use reference-style links: here is [an example][a label].

[a label]: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links

You can use links to make a table of contents:

1. [Basics](#basics)
    1. [Lists](#lists)
    1. [Markup styles](#markup-styles)
    1. [Code](#code)
    1. [Quotes](#quotes)
    1. [Footnotes](#footnotes)
    1. [Tables](#tables)
    1. [Horizontal lines](#horizontal-lines)
    1. [Links](#links)
    1. [Images](#images)
    1. [Escaping special characters](#escaping-special-characters)
2. [Advanced](#advanced)
    1. [Underline](#underline)
    1. [Indent](#indent)
    1. [Center](#center)
    1. [Color](#color)
    1. [Image size and caption](#image-size-and-caption)

### Images

An image, located within `docs/images`:

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /images/example.png %})

### Escaping special characters

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

## Advanced

There are some useful things that Markdown doesn't support. Here are some workarounds:

### Underline

<ins>This text is underlined</ins>.

### Indent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every "&nbsp" is replaced by a white space.

### Center

<center>This text is centered.</center>

### Color

<font color="red">This text is red!</font>

### Image size and caption

<center>
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/example.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="a title">
        <figcaption>_A caption, in italics._</figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>
